Scenario: You are managing two Compute Engine instances, vm-web and vm-db, located in the same VPC but in different zones within the us-central1 region. You want to ensure that vm-web can communicate with vm-db using the lowest possible latency and the lowest cost.

What should you do?

A. Assign a static external IP to vm-db and have vm-web connect to it using that IP.

B. Use the default internal DNS name to connect from vm-web to vm-db.

C. Create a Global Load Balancer to route traffic between the two instances.

D. Configure a VPN tunnel between the two zones to encrypt the traffic.
